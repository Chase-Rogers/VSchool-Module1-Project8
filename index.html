            Blue when the mouse hovers over the square.<br><br>
            Red when the mouse button is held down over the square.<br><br>
            Yellow when the mouse button is let go over the square.<br><br>
            Green when the mouse is double clicked in the square.<br><br>
            Orange when the mouse scroll is used somewhere in the window (not just over the square).<br><br>
            You should also be able to press the first letter of the colors (typing "r" on the keyboard for "red", for example) and have the box change to that color.
